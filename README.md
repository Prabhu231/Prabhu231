# Welcome to the world of Prabhu Patil 🌟

Hey there! I'm Prabhu, a passionate and fun-loving web developer with an unshakable love for all things tech. 🚀 Whether it's building sleek UIs or optimizing backend architectures, I pour my heart into crafting amazing web experiences that solve real-world problems.

## 🌍 My Web Projects

I’m super excited to share with you some of the projects I've worked on. These are my digital playgrounds where I experiment, learn, and create!

### 1. [**prabhupatil.com**](https://prabhupatil.com)
A personal portfolio where I showcase my skills, projects, and everything that fuels my tech passion. From sleek designs to powerful functionality, this is where you get to know the person behind the code. Check it out to get a glimpse of my journey and vision for the future of web development.

### 2. [**hintcode.in**](https://hintcode.in)
A platform for developers, where I combine my love for solving algorithmic problems with a slick interface. Here, users can practice coding challenges in various domains like dynamic programming, graphs, and arrays. Built with Next.js and Django, this is my proud tech playground that keeps evolving!

### 3. [**autoscheduler.in**](https://autoscheduler.in)
This is a project close to my heart. It’s a smart content scheduling tool for social media platforms like Instagram, Twitter, and WhatsApp. You can schedule posts, reels, stories, and more, all through a powerful backend with Django and a front-end that's as intuitive as it is efficient.

## ⚡ Tech Stack

I believe in using the right tool for the job! Here are some of the frameworks and technologies I’m super comfortable with:

- **React & Next.js**: My go-to tools for creating responsive and dynamic user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: The backbone for scalable, high-performance applications.
- **Django & Django REST Framework**: I love building robust backends with Django and making them API-first with DRF.
- **JWT Authentication & OAuth**: I make sure that user data is secure with efficient authentication mechanisms.

## 🎯 What Drives Me

I’m not just about building projects — I’m all about building experiences that make a difference. Every line of code I write is a step towards creating something bigger, something better. I believe in the power of technology to transform lives, and I’m here to do just that — one project at a time. 🔥
