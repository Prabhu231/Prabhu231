## üíº Experience

### KPMG Assurance and Consulting Services
#### SDE Student Intern

- Built a full-featured **authentication and authorization system** in a **React-Django** application using **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**, with **role-based access control** and **permission management** to secure sensitive data and endpoints.
  
- Designed **interactive data dashboards** with **graph visualizations** of user logins and associated activity, alongside comprehensive **paginated views** for user logs, client data, and asset management.

- Implemented advanced **data ingestion workflows** with support for **Excel uploads**, **background processing**, **progress tracking**, and **rollback functionality**, enabling reliable and scalable handling of large datasets.

- Automated **user lifecycle management** using **Windows Task Scheduler** to deactivate dormant accounts after a month of inactivity, improving system hygiene and resource optimization.

- Conducted **backend performance benchmarking** on datasets (10K‚Äì1.5M records), selecting the **Django + MySQL stack** for optimal scalability and faster query handling in production.



## üåç My Web Projects

I‚Äôm super excited to share with you some of the projects I've worked on. These are my digital playgrounds where I experiment, learn, and create!

### 1. <a href="https://prabhupatil.com" target="_blank">**prabhupatil.com**</a>
A personal portfolio where I showcase my skills, projects, and everything that fuels my tech passion. From sleek designs to powerful functionality, this is where you get to know the person behind the code. Check it out to get a glimpse of my journey and vision for the future of web development.

### 2. [**hintcode.in**](https://hintcode.in)
Hintcode is a full-stack platform to practice data structures and algorithms with real-time C++ code evaluation. It features a built-in editor, 50+ curated problems, automated test validation, and AI-powered hints to help users learn, debug, and improve efficiently.

### 3. [**autoscheduler.in**](https://autoscheduler.in)
This is a project close to my heart. Autoscheduler is a powerful tool designed to help you schedule and send bulk emails with file attachments to up to 50 BCC recipients in a single operation. Whether you're managing marketing campaigns, sending reports, or sharing updates, Autoscheduler simplifies the process of automating email deliveries.

## ‚ö° Tech Stack

I believe in using the right tool for the job! Here are some of the frameworks and technologies I‚Äôm super comfortable with:

- **React & Next.js**: My go-to tools for creating responsive and dynamic user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: The backbone for scalable, high-performance applications.
- **Django**: I love building robust backends with Django and making them API-first with DRF.
- **PostgreSQL (PgSQL)**: A powerful, open-source relational database. I love using it for complex queries and structured data. With support for ACID compliance and advanced features like JSONB, it's my go-to choice for relational data.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that's perfect for projects where flexibility and scalability are key. I use MongoDB when I need to store unstructured or semi-structured data, and its performance with large datasets makes it an excellent choice for high-traffic applications.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types. It helps me write more reliable, maintainable, and scalable code, especially in large applications. The type safety feature helps catch errors early, making the development process smoother and more enjoyable.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that lets me build modern and responsive designs with ease. It‚Äôs super customizable, and I love how quickly I can create clean, well-structured UIs without writing a lot of custom CSS.



## üéØ What Drives Me

I‚Äôm not just about building projects ‚Äî I‚Äôm all about building experiences that make a difference. Every line of code I write is a step towards creating something bigger, something better. I believe in the power of technology to transform lives, and I‚Äôm here to do just that ‚Äî one project at a time. üî•
