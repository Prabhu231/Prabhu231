## 🌍 My Web Projects

I’m super excited to share with you some of the projects I've worked on. These are my digital playgrounds where I experiment, learn, and create!

A personal portfolio where I showcase my skills, projects, and everything that fuels my tech passion. From sleek designs to powerful functionality, this is where you get to know the person behind the code. Check it out to get a glimpse of my journey and vision for the future of web development.

### 2. [**hintcode.in**](https://hintcode.in)
Hintcode is a full-stack platform to practice data structures and algorithms with real-time C++ code evaluation. It features a built-in editor, 50+ curated problems, automated test validation, and AI-powered hints to help users learn, debug, and improve efficiently.

### 3. [**autoscheduler.in**](https://autoscheduler.in)
This is a project close to my heart. Autoscheduler is a powerful tool designed to help you schedule and send bulk emails with file attachments to up to 50 BCC recipients in a single operation.

## ⚡ Tech Stack

I believe in using the right tool for the job! Here are some of the frameworks and technologies I’m super comfortable with:

- **React & Next.js**: My go-to tools for creating responsive and dynamic user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: The backbone for scalable, high-performance applications.
- **Django**: I love building robust backends with Django and making them API-first with DRF.
- **JWT Authentication & OAuth**: I make sure that user data is secure with efficient authentication mechanisms.

## 🎯 What Drives Me

I’m not just about building projects — I’m all about building experiences that make a difference. Every line of code I write is a step towards creating something bigger, something better. I believe in the power of technology to transform lives, and I’m here to do just that — one project at a time. 🔥
